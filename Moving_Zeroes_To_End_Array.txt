Using two pointer Approach 

1) Both pointing to the start index.

2) Move 2nd pointer and check value at that index 
  a) If it is Zero, just increment 2nd pointer and do nothing.
  b) If it is Non-Zero, just assign that non-zero value to the 
     index pointed by 1st pointer then increment both pointers and 'continue' 
     (to skip 'j' incremental).

3) At last out of loop , place one for loop till n for i , and assign 0 to indexes
